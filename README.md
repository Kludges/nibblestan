**NIBBLESTAN 1.0**

This is basically a straightforward port of the Stanley Freelancer HTML Template from blacktie.co. I made this as my practical study on how the Nibbleblog templating system works.

Overall, porting the theme took around two hours. This still needs some more cleaning up but it's at the point where it's good enough to use on my blog.

Basic features include:


-  Bootstrap 3.0.3, Multi-Device Support
-  Facebook and Disqus comments enabled
-  Single Column
-  Tested on Nibbleblog 4.0.3
-  Syntax Highlighting Support using Rainbow.js

Nibbleblog is great if you just need a basic blog. It's a flatfile blog written in PHP. It can be integrated with a Database if needed.
